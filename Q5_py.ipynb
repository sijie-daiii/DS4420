    "A normal distribution is unbounded on both sides, which conflicts with the fact that song durations can never be negative and often cluster within a certain range. Furthermore, song durations tend to exhibit some degree of right skew, whereas the normal distribution assumes symmetry around the mean, suggesting the normal model may not be the most suitable for this feature."
