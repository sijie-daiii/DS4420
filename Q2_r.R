# One reason to examine the release month of songs is to detect seasonal 
# trends or patterns that might influence a songâ€™s popularity. For instance, 
# if certain months tend to generate higher listener engagement or coincide 
# with specific events (e.g., summer break or holiday releases), artists 
# and record labels can use this information to optimize their release 
# schedules and promotional efforts.
